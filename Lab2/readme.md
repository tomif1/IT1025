## Executive Summary 
In this chapter I learned about the different types of hardware that make up a computer and how they all do different tasks. Most types of computer hardware can be broken up into two parts, input and output. An input device on a computer is a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen and an output device would be a display, a printer or a speaker. Another type of computer hardware is the internal parts of a computer like a cpu, ram, a hard drive and more. The internal parts of a computer make it work and are an important part of its operation. They also discussed Moore's law and how every two years computing power will double for the same price point. Then they talked about how nowadays smartphones are growing in popularity and one of the best points about them is they are mobile and you can do almost everything you can do on a computer.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the difference between the time a request for data is made and the time that the data becomes availaible and the transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the hard drive. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
In solid state drives do not use spinning disks like on hard drives but instead datat is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. Solid state drives are faster because they don't use spinning disks which take time to get working which are why hard drives are slower.
#### Random Access Memory
Increasing the ram makes the computer run faster because the more ram you have the more files can be loaded onto it. So then with more ram if the cpu is running a program and it can all be loaded onto the ram then it will not have to access the slow hard drive for some files. The difference between 64 bits and 32 bits is that 64 bits transfers that many bits in a clock cycle while 32 bits transfers that many bits in a clock cyle. Therefore 64 bits is 2 times faster than a 32 bit proccesor
### ALU and the Control Unit
The control unit receives an instruction from ram and then tells the ALU what type of operation to perform and the ALU outputs the operation. Sometimes the ALU doesn't have to perform an operation but instead uses flags which helps the control unit on what to do when it recieves the next instruction.
### CPU, Input & Output
When you are pumping gas at a gas station it addresses each of the components that are input, store, process, and output information. A pump at a gas station input is the amount of gas used by the user. It then stores this data and then has to process the amount due by the user by multiplying the price of the gas and the amount used. Finally it outputs to the user the amount due for the amount of gas they used.
### Logic Gates 
A truth table shows every output for every possible combination of inputs. The AND gate is only turned on when both inputs are on, while the OR gate requires just one input to be on for it to turn on.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
The purpose of IEEE is advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. They focus on ethics because they want to foster awarness on ethical issues, promote ethical behavior among those working in fields of IEEE interest and create a world in which engineers and scientist are respected for exemplary ethical behavior. 
## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal is the number in its normal for like 169, binary is the number in 1s and 0s which would be 10101001 and hexadecimal is similar to binary in the highest number but unlike binary has a base of 16 and only uses 2 numbers.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The color #ab00ff is 171, 0, 255 and is a bright purple. This color would be problematic in a website because if it was used as the text or the background it would hard to make out the words and strain the users eyes and make them want to leave. When choosing a color you should make sure it isn't too bright is easy to read on if it's the background and goes with a theme.
