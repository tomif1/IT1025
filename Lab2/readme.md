## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the difference between the time a request for data is made and the time that the data becomes availaible and the transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the hard drive. 
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
In solid state drives do not use spinning disks like on hard drives but instead datat is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. Solid state drives are faster because they don't use spinning disks which take time to get working which are why hard drives are slower.
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
