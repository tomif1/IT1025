## Executive Summary 
In this chapter I learned about the software that makes a computer run. They talked about the different types of software which can be categorized by Operating System, like Microsoft Windows and MacOs, and the other type is Application Software, like video games and word proccesors. I learned that Microsoft success is because of their productivity software like word processing, spreadsheet and presentation. I also learned that when you purchase a software you own a license to the product, which means you can't resell it and the owner of the software takes steps to protect themselves. I also learned about cloud computing and how it allows for the user to access the files from any computer as long as it has an internet connection.

## Software
### Types of Software
Application software is used to accomplish a specific goal, utility software consists of programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way and an operating system is the first thing loaded in when the computer starts and it manages all the programs in the computer. An example of application software is a video game, an example of utility software is antivirus software, and an example of operating aystem is Microsoft Windows. 
### ERP
The purpose of ERP to bring together an entire organization within one program. It uses a central database that is implemented throughout the entire orginization. An example of a few types of ERP software are NetSuite, Tipalti, and Rossum. 
## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
A common IT problem solved by virtualization was that companies could partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. This allowed servers to be run more efficiently.
### Role of Hypervisor
The role of a hypervisor is to sepereate the physical resources from the virtual enviroments. An example of a hypervisor can be a laptop or can be directly installed on hardware like a server.
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Pseudo-code means the plain language description of the steps in an algorithim or another system. What they mean by "pseudo-code nature of Python?" is that it is easy to understand what is being run in the code, even if you are not sure how to write in that coding language. 
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is converted from the source language into a language that can read by your computer like binary, by using a compiler with various flags and options. On the other hand an interpreted language does not need to be compiled to binary, you can just run the program directly from the source code.
