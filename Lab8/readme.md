## Executive Summary 
In this lab they teach you about data, information and knowledge and they teach you about the different parts of a database. Then you get to practice how to use SQL to organize databases and learn about SQL injections. Then you learn about the code of ethics and how it works and how a trademark protects your intelectual property.

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent, information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose, and knowledge in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area.

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key: A special filed or a combination of fields that determines the unique record
#### Relationship between customers and orders: Each order can only be assigned to one customer but a customer can have multiple orders
#### Foreign key of orders table: a field in one table that connects to the primary key data in the original table
### Field Data Types
It is important to define the data type because if you don't and someones sees the data in the field it can be interpreted many different ways
### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
The four big V's of data are volume, variety, velocity and variability. Volume means that the size of data plays a very crucial role in determining value out of data. Variety  refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. Velocity refers to the speed of generation of data and how fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data. Variability refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times, thus hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
The types of technology that are driving the need for big data are social media, the stock exchange, and a jet.
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
RDBMS or Relational Database Management System is the basis for SQL and the data in RDBMS is stored in table and SQL is a language that handles the information in a table.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections
SQL injections are a security threat because it can destroy your database and it usually occurs when you ask a user for their input and they give you a SQL statement that is unwillingly run on your database. To protect yourself from a SQL injection you can use parameters which are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.
## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
The purpose of the code of ethics is to outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group. ACM created a code for the computing discipline because it clarifies the acceptable standards of behavior for a professional group.
### Intellectual Property
A trademark would protect others from being able to use your image and make it so only your company can use that logo on your products. It would be important to copyright the svg because then you are the only company that can use it on their products.
### Information Collection
COPPA makes sure that organizations must make a good-faith effort to determine the age of those accessing their websites and, if users are under thirteen years old, must obtain parental consent before collecting any information, FERPA is a US law that protects the privacy of student education records and HIPAA is the law the specifically singles out records related to health care as a special class of personally identifiable information.
## Conclusion
In this chapter I learned the difference between data, information and knowledge. I then learned about databases and how to use SQL to rearrange the information so it only displayed what I wanted. I learned about SQL injections and how they work by inputing a SQL statement in an input. Then I learned about the code of ethics and the role it serves and trademarks and how they protect customers from being sold many different products with the same name and logo. Then I read about COPPA, FERPA and HIPAA and what they do to regulate what information can be collected from U.S. citizens.
