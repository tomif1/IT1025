## Lucidchart
In Lucidchart I learned how to create diagrams and to make a program example. I also learned how each different part works in a diagram and I learned the basics of using Lucidchart and how to export a diagram.
## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:
Unit of data 
#### Packet-Switching:
Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
#### IP Address:
Unique identifying number 
#### DNS:
Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
#### Protocol:
Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
A switch is similar to a hub but better because a switch is intelligent and can learn the addresses of the devices connected to it. The data that goes into a switch will only be directed into the inteded port, unlike a hub that will output it to all ports.
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
A switch and hub can only transport data over a LAN but a router forwards data from one network to another based on their IP address.
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
A single point of failure is if a switch or central hub would fail then all computers on that point would be affected. The topologies that experience this are the Star and Ring topolgy.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
The infrastructure topology has wired connections and has a wireless access point connected to the switch by a cable.
### Network Design
### NSA/CSS

## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
#### Authentication
#### ACL and RBAC
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
#### Public Key Cryptography

### Cryptography
#### Encryption
#### Frequency Fingerprint
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
#### Polyalphabetic Example
