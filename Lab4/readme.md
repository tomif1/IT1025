## Executive Summary 
In this chapter they talk about how the hardware and software work in a computer and then they teach you how to use both Windows and MacOS. They teach you how to use the command prompt and how to create files using the command prompt. Then they teach you how to create a basic commands in python and the basics of using it. Then you use about the basics of using images, the different types and how to create a custom image.

## Python IDLE
The python shell runs the code you create in the python IDLE. You can also use the python shell to test code by entering it in and pressing enter button to run the code.
## Code Examples
### Variable: 
A variable is a value that can change; myAge
### Assignment statement: 
A way to assign a value to a variable; myAge = 19
### Function: 
A function is a block of code that is run when it is called;
def calculateBitrthAge():
     birthAge = 2021 - myAge
### Three data types: 
String, integers, and float
An example of a string is 
    example1 = "Hello"
An example of a integer is 
    example1 = 402
An example of a float is 
    example3 = 6.9

## Graphics
### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster images are made up of tiny little pixels so when you zoom into the photo it loses quality, while vector images are rendered using a special form of geometry so when you zoom in it does not lose quality.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless compression means that all the data from the original file is preserved, while lossy compression on the other hand removes some data from the original file so that it saves with a reduced file size.
### File Formats
A gif, jpeg and png files are very similar because they can hold images but they have very different properties. A gif allows for animated images and up to 8 bits per second, but because of gifs limited color palette photos with gradients or simple color shifts become posterized. A jpeg uses lossy compression to create smaller file sizes but the photos are prone to artification and you can see pixelation and strange halos around certain sections of an image. A png use lossless compression and supports palette-based color and supports a number of transperancy options.
### File Properties
In file properties you can find the type of file, how mcuh space it takes up and the time created, modified and last accessed.
## Conclusion
In this lab I learned how to make simple code in python and how to print, get input and do equations within python. I also learned how python works and how to use the shell and IDLE and their different purposes. I also learned how to create a photo using vectr and the different types of properties that are applied to different types of photos.
