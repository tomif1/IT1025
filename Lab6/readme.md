## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP address are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces and computers translate the website address to an IP address. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv6 is significantly bigger than IPv4 having a 128-bit address space, which is 340 undecillion addresses compared to IPv4's 4 billion unique IP addresses.
#### ICANN
ICANN is a nonprofit orginization that helps to coordinates these unique identifiers across the world and without that coordination we wouldnâ€™t have one global Internet.
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
The responsibility of TCP/IP is that it creates a virtual IP port and the network hardware and software is responsible for routing data in and out of each virtual IP port.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
TCP/IP conncections work similarly as a telephone call where someone has to initiate the connection by dialing the phone and someone on the other side is listening to the calls and picks up when a call comes in. The IP is the telephone number and the port number is the particular extension once the call has been answered.
#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology because when you change one layer it will not affect the rest of the layers allowing you to edit any layer you want without affecting the other layers in the application.
#### Application Layer
The types of applications that run on an application layer are HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, and SNMP.
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is the protocol used for viewing web pages on the internet and it supports the clients server model because it partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
Secure HTTP uses Secure Socket Layers or SSL protects data by using a public key encryption to secure data and uses a SSL certificate to authenticate the identity of the website. Another one is Transport Layer Security which is the succesor to SSL and authenticates the server, client and encrypts the data.
