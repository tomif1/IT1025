## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP address are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces and computers translate the website address to an IP address. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is that IPv6 is significantly bigger than IPv4 having a 128-bit address space, which is 340 undecillion addresses compared to IPv4's 4 billion unique IP addresses.
#### ICANN
ICANN is a nonprofit orginization that helps to coordinates these unique identifiers across the world and without that coordination we wouldnâ€™t have one global Internet.
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
The responsibility of TCP/IP is that it creates a virtual IP port and the network hardware and software is responsible for routing data in and out of each virtual IP port.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
TCP/IP conncections work similarly as a telephone call where someone has to initiate the connection by dialing the phone and someone on the other side is listening to the calls and picks up when a call comes in. The IP is the telephone number and the port number is the particular extension once the call has been answered.
#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology because when you change one layer it will not affect the rest of the layers allowing you to edit any layer you want without affecting the other layers in the application.
#### Application Layer
The types of applications that run on an application layer are HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, and SNMP.
## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is the protocol used for viewing web pages on the internet and it supports the clients server model because it partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
Secure HTTP uses Secure Socket Layers or SSL protects data by using a public key encryption to secure data and uses a SSL certificate to authenticate the identity of the website. Another one is Transport Layer Security which is the succesor to SSL and authenticates the server, client and encrypts the data.
## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
You should secure your browser because it can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
### Risk Explained
One of the risks which is that web page addresses can be disguised or take you to an unexpected site which can install malware on your device and damage it
## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
 Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and Director and he created the W3C to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.
 The standard that I chose was web of devices and it is important because of it focuses on technologies to enable Web access anywhere, anytime, using any device. 
### HTML5 and CSS
I used html to create the basics for the website and used css to format the website.
### HTML and XML
XML differs from HTML because even though it is a markup language XML doesn't actually do anything and was designed to be self descriptive.
## Components of a URL
### scheme: https
### domain: www.amazon.com
### top level domain: .edu
