## Executive Summary 
In this lab they teach you about file compression and how it can reduce file size. They also teach about the different aspects of the python class and how to create an object from a class. Then they teach you about inheritance by a class and how encapsulation and abstraction and about UML and how to model a python class.
## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression a way to group, or archive, multiple files so they act like one file.
### Compression and File Size
The difference is that when you compress a file the amount of space it takes us is considerably less than if it is not compressed and it is in it's normal state.
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
The attributes of the shark class are shark.swim() and shark.be_awesome()
### Methods:
The methods of the shark class are swim() and be_awesome()
### Constructor:
The purpose of the constructor method is to initialize data and is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
### Class vs. Object
A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object and a object is an instance of a class. When you instantiate an object from a class it means you create an instance of that class
## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
The instantiated objects from the shark class are all the objects created from that class so it would be the objects sammy and stevie.
### Inheritance
Inheritance reduces programming labor by using common objects easily by allowing one class to inherit from another class and you can add any additional details about new attributes or behaviors that are unique to that the new class. An example of inheritance is creating another class named great_white_shark that inherits the shark class and you add specfics about the great white shark.
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation applies to the shark class because it puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. Abstraction applies to the shark class because it hides the inner function of the class and the user only knows what the function does but not how it does.
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
My class has the private variable name and the two public methods swim and be_awesome with the variable name in both of the methods. 
## Conclusion
In this chapter I learned about file compression and how it can reduce the amount of space a file takes up. I also learn about the different parts of a class and how it works in a class. I learned about inheritance, encapsulation and abstraction and how it applies to a class. Then I learned about UML and I created my own model for a shark class.
