## Executive Summary
In Lab 1 the goal was to be able to learn how to set up and to use the basics of Github and also how to use the snipping tool to take screenshots of our work. Then I saw how to use markdown in Github and how different symbols in a Github file can give you different results. After that I read Chapter 1 of the book and learned about the 5 basic components of a information system and how commputers have developed over the past 70 years.

## Information System Components
1) Hardware - an example of hardware is a keyboard
2) Software - an example of software is an Operating System
3) Data - an example of data in an information system is your address, phone number and your social networking account
4) People - an example of people in an information system is a CIO
5) Processes - an example of a process in an information system is a program that is running like word
## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
A client-server architecture is a way to allow users to log in to the LAN from their computer by connecting to a server and the server would lookup permissions for each user and determine who had accesss to different resources. Github is a client-server architecture because that is how github operates. A server determines which user has access to different files and what type of access they have like viewing or editing.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a way to allow users with mobile access to data and applications. An example of cloud computing is Google cloud.
## Conclusion
In this lab I learned about the history of infromation systems and the components that go into it. I learned about that the first long distance transmission was over 350 miles on the ARPA Net which was the beginning of the Internet and that in the 1970s only large companies expanded from the local network to the internet. I also learned that computers used to be the size of a room and time-sharing allowed multiple users to access the mainframe at the same time. I would also like to learn more about how the first computer and internet worked and how limited it was.
