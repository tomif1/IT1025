### Executive Summary
My final project was a python program that allowed the user to add, edit, delete and print the information. The user can choose one of the four options and if the user tries to enter a letter or an option that is not one of the four it will raise an error. If the user chooses to add a username and password, then it brings up the prompt to add a username, password and location for where it is used. If the user chooses to edit the data than you can have the option to choose which number you want to edit and enter a new username, password or location. If the user wanted to delete one of the lines of data they just have to enter the number of the data line that you want to delete and finally the print function just prints all the data in the list.

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan
I plan to create a project using python that has a hub that can store all of your passwords and you can access it by searching the site name, or the username. You can also add a description to the password and username and it requires a password to access the database in the first place to keep the passwords secure.

### Project Part 2:
If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.

### Conclusion
In making this project I learned how to use python in depth and how to create lists and edit the data within them. I also learned how to make it so that if an error is found it does not bring the error up and end the program, it just prints a message out instead. I learned the different things you can use with lists like pop() which deletes a item from the list depending on what number is in the parantheses, insert() which allows the user to input data at a specified point in the list and for row in list which allows you to access data in a list of lists and allows you to format and print out the data easily.
