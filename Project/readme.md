### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I plan to create a project using python that has a hub that can store all of your passwords and you can access it by searching the site name, or the username. You can also add a description to the password and username and it requires a password to access the database in the first place to keep the passwords secure.
### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.
